# Litecoin Growth Simulation

This repository contains a Python library for simulating user growth and daily transactions in a system, influenced by various factors including logistic growth models and external factors like BTC hashrate. The library also includes Monte Carlo simulations to account for uncertainty and confidence intervals.

## Features

- **Simulate User Growth and Transactions**: Model user growth over time and calculate daily transactions.
- **Simulate Growth with BTC Hashrate Influence**: Integrate external factors like BTC hashrate to simulate growth more realistically.
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Perform multiple simulations to generate confidence intervals and understand the variability in predictions.
- **Customizable Plots**: Generate and save plots for analysis, with support for various customization options.

## Installation

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/litecoin-foundation/litecoin_analytics.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage 

For now, you can rely on the [`main.py`](https://github.com/litecoin-foundation/litecoin_analytics/blob/main/main.py) script to access and utilize the key functions of the project. The script includes all the essential functionalities that will eventually be packaged into a standalone library.


## Simulate User Growth and Transactions

```python
results = simulate_user_growth_and_transactions(
    initial_users=1000,
    carrying_capacity=100000,
    growth_rate=0.10,
    usage_rate=0.8,
    time_steps=365,
    start_date="2024-01-01",
    figsize=(12, 6),
    plot=True,
    return_results=True,
    label_fontsize=12,
    tick_fontsize=10,
    save_plot=True,
    image_path_png="user_growth.png",
    image_path_svg="user_growth.svg"
)
```

## Parameters

All functions in the library provide flexibility through several parameters. These include:

- `initial_users`: Initial number of users.  
- `carrying_capacity`: Maximum number of users the system can support.  
- `growth_rate`: Growth rate per time step.  
- `usage_rate`: Proportion of users who use the system daily.  
- `time_steps`: Number of days to simulate.  
- `plot`: Whether to plot the results.  
- `return_results`: Whether to return the results as a DataFrame.  
- `save_plot`: Whether to save the generated plots.

Refer to the docstrings within each function for detailed descriptions of all parameters.
